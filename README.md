# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

## Description

In this project I made my first website completely from scratch. In it I have three pages: a Homepage, Portfolio, and Contact page, which each have their own design and styling. I utilized the Bootstrap website for documentation that allowed me to style my elements with little CSS support. Through this I have achieved a significantly better understanding of Bootstrap components and how they work in an HTML document. I made use of the grid system from Bootstrap that allowed me to place elements in the appropriate place with complementary styling to go along with it. I feel much more comfortable with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap now that I have finished and have a final product to show for it.

## Goals

* Create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.
